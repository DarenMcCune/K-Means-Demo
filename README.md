# K-Means-Demo
This is an implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm, written for a linear algebra class. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a visual aid for the precise mechanics of the algorithm, i.e. a graph for the end result of the algorithm. The edges are still a rough, but I will be updating it as time permits.

Requirements:
Python3(numpy, matplotlib, sklearn)
