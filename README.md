# K-Means-Demo
This is an implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm, written for a linear algebra class. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a visual aid for the precise mechanics of the algorithm, i.e. a graph that allows the user to step through each iteration of the algorithm. The actual algorithm is written in C, with python used to interface with the plotly service to graph the algorithm. Currently working on cleaning up the code and improving the k-means runtime.
